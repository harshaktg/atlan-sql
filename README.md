# Atlan SQL Runner

This app is just a mock app built using NextJS (React JS).

It is used to execute SQL queries on user input from the Product table present in the app. The app has provision to toggle between different past queries executed, and to view all the entries from the Product table in our app. As a data source we've used data from [here](https://github.com/graphql-compose/graphql-compose-examples/blob/master/examples/northwind/data/json/products.json).

## Dependencies

- [Ant Design](https://www.npmjs.com/package/antd) - Used for Text area, Menu, Table and button components
- [Nano ID](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nanoid) = Used to set unique ID for different queries

## To run locally

To run the app locally, use `yarn` to install dependencies, and then use `yarn dev` to run in local environment

```
yarn

yarn dev
```
